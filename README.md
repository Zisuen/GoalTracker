This is my first ever application. Too much work not enought time to work on personal projects...

It is a Goal Tracker application, with future plans for To-Do list, Habits tracker, maybe some other features as well

First use case will be with SUPABASE backend
Later on we might add offline functionality, to keep all data on device, which we might add only as an offline option, with online sync once user connects to internet

Classic installation
yarn; npx pod-install
yarn start

and run on iOS (FOR NOW)

Future plans are for Android implementation, with Web interaction, so your data are synced across all devices. You will potentially be able to view on iOS, Android and Web.
